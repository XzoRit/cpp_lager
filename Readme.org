* lager
Before using lager as header only lib one has to do the following steps
- cd external/lager
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake .. -D lager_BUILD_DEBUGGER=OFF -D lager_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -D lager_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -D lager_BUILD_DOCS=OFF
Otherwise the lager/config.hpp is not available since it is generated by cmake
